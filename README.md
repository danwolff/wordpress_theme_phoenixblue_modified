# Introduction 

This is a slightly customized version of the "PhoenixBlue" Wordpress theme, an awesome old-school Wordpress theme.

This theme is probably most recognizable for its longtime use on "one of the most popular language sites on the Internet", Language Log (the [quote is from per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Log)).

If you have used any recent Wordpress versions, you might have noticed that the searchable theme selection lacks truly classic style themes.  This is a great classic theme.  Tt is added here so that it can be used where basic, usable Wordpress theming is needed.

There is a small amount of customization built in for simplicity integrating custom newsfeed shortcodes [from a Wordpress plugin in another repo](https://github.com/danwolff/wordpress_newsfeed_tokens_with_username).

# Customization

The header and sidebar are slightly updated, e.g. to use custom shortcodes for the newsfeeds.

# Original source

The base for this theme was found available online in a couple of versions.  Some links appear offline, so took a little link traversal to locate.  Linking best as possible:

- Canonical original link: [http://www.mikeschepker.com/wordpress/phoenixblu.zip](http://www.mikeschepker.com/wordpress/phoenixblu.zip) [offline]

# Credits

I take no credit for making this theme.  All credit for the aweseome usability is due to the original authors as credit is retained in the source code ("Mike Schepker & David Peralty"); see the following website to thank the an original author: [https://mikeschepker.com/](Mike).

# Explanation

This repo is hosted here for a couple practical reasons, as follows:

1. For resilience and ease of reference, since the original theme sourcing might become difficult to dig up,

2. Because great simple themes like this are apparently few and far between now, and

2. For ease of reuse, since there is indeed a very small amount of customization in place.
