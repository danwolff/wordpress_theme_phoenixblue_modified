# Introduction 

This is a slightly customized version of (a modified from of) the "PhoenixBlue" Wordpress theme, an awesome old-school Wordpress theme.

- The PhoenixBlue theme is probably most recognizable for its longtime use on "one of the most popular language sites on the Internet", Language Log (the [quote is from per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Log)).

Why include an old style theme for Wordpress here?  If you have used any recent Wordpress versions, you might have noticed that the searchable theme selection lacks truly classic style themes!  PhoenixBlue is a great example of a truly classic theme.  It is added here so that it can be applied where basic, usable Wordpress theming may be helpful.

# Customization

There is a very small amount of customization built into the version under `modified_theme_source/` and `modified_theme_zip` for simplicity in integrating custom newsfeed shortcodes [as in a Wordpress plugin in an adjacent another repo](https://github.com/danwolff/wordpress_newsfeed_tokens_with_username).

- Specifically, the header and sidebar are slightly updated, e.g. to use custom shortcodes for newsfeed links.

- Thus, it might make the most sense for you to start with a more original version appearing in `original_reference_themes/` instead.

# Original source, credits, and provenance

## Sourcing, credits, and provenance

The base for this theme was found available online in a few versions, all of which appear to be nearly identical; all such (Zip) archives are included "as found" in `original_reference_themes/` for completeness.  It appears that there may have ben two major releases, v.01 and v.02, with a possible third modified version.  Some links below appear offline, as noted below, so it took a little link traversal to locate the public sources.  Most immediately, here are some references to give a starting point:

- A source of one of the included Zip archives, "v0.2" (released 2006-02-02): [https://web.archive.org/web/20070708084809/http://www.digitallifenews.com/phoenixtheme/phoenixtheme02.zip](https://web.archive.org/web/20070708084809/http://www.digitallifenews.com/phoenixtheme/phoenixtheme02.zip) [online]
  - As linked from the "Phoenixtheme v0.2" [post on phoenixrealm.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317094832/http://www.phoenixrealm.com/2006/02/02/phoenixtheme-v02/) at that time.  The release notes include the following text: "a useable, simple, and effective WordPress theme".  One would have to agree.
- A source for "v0.1" (released 2005-12-19): [https://web.archive.org/web/20060104130128/http://www.digitallifenews.com/phoenixtheme/phoenixtheme.zip](https://web.archive.org/web/20060104130128/http://www.digitallifenews.com/phoenixtheme/phoenixtheme.zip) [online]
  - As linked from the "Phoenixtheme v0.1" [post on digitallifenews.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20051230170147/http://www.digitallifenews.com/phoenixtheme/) at that time.  The release notes include the following text: "an easy to use theme...the theme is graphically simple...the theme should be fast loading".  Again, one would have to agree.

I take no credit for making this theme.  All credit for the aweseome usability is due to the original authors, just as credit appears and is retained in the source code ("Mike Schepker & David Peralty").  Websites of the original authors appeared to be: [https://mikeschepker.com/](Mike) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610070203/http://www.digitallifenews.com/](David).

# Explanation

This repo is hosted here for a few practical reasons, as follows:

1. For resilience and ease of reference, since the original theme sourcing might become difficult to dig up with time,

2. Because great, simple themes like this are apparently few and far between now (or at least are not directly linked from current theme search pages), and

2. For ease of reuse, since there is indeed a very small amount of customization in place.
